TASK-1
# Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & ML 🚢

This project involves cleaning, preprocessing, and applying a basic ML model on the Titanic dataset using Python in Google Colab.

## 📌 Tasks Performed

- Loaded dataset using `kagglehub`
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Dropped unused columns (Cabin, Ticket, Name, etc.)
- Encoded categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Standardized numerical features (`Age`, `Fare`, etc.)
- Visualized and removed outliers
- Split data into train/test sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report


TASK 2
🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **exploratory data analysis** on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival.

## 🔍 Key Tasks

- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std)
- Created histograms and boxplots for numerical features
- Plotted correlation matrix and pairplot to analyze relationships
- Visualized survival trends by gender, class, and fare
- Highlighted key insights from the data

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle ([yasserh/titanic-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset))

## ✅ Output

- ~78% accuracy using Logistic Regression
